Here we can find the scripts used for the analysis of mutidimensional motor data for the paper "Changes in the complexity of limbs movements during the first year of life across different tasks"


# Data
The data that support the findings will be available upon request from the corresponding authors following an embargo from the date of publication to allow for finalization of the ongoing longitudinal project. 

# Scripts

Main Script

- scriptRhytmicMDRQA.m -> controls the whole process of analysis. The script loads the data from one of the tasks and processes the data using multidimensional RQA on the time series of interest. Particularly:\\
      * First select all the infant codes and visits from a parent folder where all the subfolders with the sensor data are located.\\
      * Loads a conversion file which main goal is to convert the sensor internal codes to body parts of interest.
      * Prompt a gui to select which parts are of interest for the analysis and remove unimportant data to save some memory.
      * Pre-process the data by filtering and interpolating missing data.
      * Then the movement time series are generated by calculating the quaternions or by obtaining the magnitude of the acceleration.
